# CPF Generator

Tired of using online test CPF generators and willing to learn Rust, I've written this tiny program that generates and
outputs a valid random CPF number.

## Usage:

```shell
# Outputs a valid random CPF:
./cpf-generator

# Add a valid random CPF to the clipboard (Wayland only)
./cpf-generator | wl-copy
```
